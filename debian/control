Description: Data serialization system
 Avro provides rich data structures, a compact & fast binary data format, a
 container file to store persistent data, remote procedure calls (RPC), and a
 simple integration with dynamic languages. Code generation is not required to
 read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols. Code
 generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically
 typed languages.
